X.B.X — 觀察數位世界的暗流
AI systems architect. Electrical engineering contractor. Taiwan.
Building quan-agi — an open-source AGI governance framework. Not invented, discovered. Thousand-year wisdom traditions (Buddhist consciousness theory, Daoist systems thinking) translated into computational protocols.
What I'm building
GSCC — Tiered decision governance for AI agents (T0-T3 risk classification). Because "just do it" isn't governance.
Quan-Family-Framework — 14+ AI agents, tiered supervision, parallel deployment. Multi-model orchestration with human sovereignty.
AI-Skill-Governance — Antivirus for AI agents. Skill package governance before execution.
Numbers

108+ documented iteration cycles of AI system development
31 cognitive rules extracted from practice, not theory
510 repos analyzed by autonomous hunting agent
CVSS 9.2 — first security research submission (HackerOne)

Core principles
AGI = LLM + Mandala Memory + RAG + MCP + Auto-trigger + Metacognition + Emotional Core

Defense must be context awareness, not pattern matching
Memory is soul — soul must grow, not be pre-installed
pip install the seed, not the copy. A thousand different souls, one lotus heart.

Background
Small electrical contracting company in Taiwan. Security cameras, network systems, weak current engineering. The same pattern recognition that finds wiring faults now finds architectural patterns in AGI systems.
From dial-up internet to pip install quan-agi. Same drive: see what nobody has built yet, then build it.
